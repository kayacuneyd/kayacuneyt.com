Have you ever thought that Turkish society has lost its coherence, that people are losing trust in each other and in key institutions, and that the sense of justice in our community is gradually fading away due to the unsettling news we hear through traditional and social media? If so, you're not alone, and there is a theory that can help us make sense of all this: **Emile Durkheim's concept of anomie**. Anomie, in its simplest terms, describes a situation where the norms and structure of society weaken, causing individuals to feel a kind of "disorientation." In such a situation, the shared rules and norms that everyone used to follow seem to evaporate, leaving individuals adrift and lost.

You might wonder how this concept relates to contemporary Turkish society. If we were talking about a Turkey without an economic crisis, migration waves, political polarization, or a shifting perception of justice, you could be right in questioning the relevance. However, given today's realities, the question becomes: **Is what we are experiencing in today's Turkey an example of anomie?**

## What Should We Consider to Understand Society?

It is not for us to diagnose like experts, of course. However, like you, I have noticed a disturbing rise in reports of murder, suicide, harassment, assault, and smuggling in recent times. These alarming trends suggest that something is fundamentally wrong. Having read and researched certain topics that help me make sense of these phenomena, I thought it might be helpful to put my thoughts down in writing. So, what are the key indicators we should look at to assess whether a society is experiencing anomie? Let’s explore them.

### 1. **Economic Crisis and Income Inequality**

Concerns about the cost of living and the erosion of purchasing power have become a common complaint among Turkish citizens. The majority of people are struggling with an economic crisis. According to KONDA’s **Moral Index** of 2022, 83.1% of the public believed that the country was in the midst of an economic crisis, and 73.1% expected economic difficulties in the coming months (KONDA, 2022). Similarly, the **TÜİK Life Satisfaction Survey** shows that the public is deeply concerned about the rising cost of living. Economic hardships erode trust in social norms and institutions, weakening the glue that holds society together.

Former Turkish President Süleyman Demirel once summarized this situation by saying, “Inflation is something that destroys states. It corrupts nations from the inside. It is not just a matter of prices going up; it corrodes morality”.

The economic crisis in Turkey has also exacerbated youth unemployment, driving many individuals towards illegal activities such as betting, prostitution, and other criminal behaviors:
- **Unemployment and Uncertainty About the Future:** With jobs hard to come by due to the economic crisis, young people face growing uncertainty about their future, pushing them towards alternative (and often illegal) ways to make money.
- **Income Inequality:** During times of economic crisis, income disparities grow wider. Young people increasingly notice the stark gap between the wealthy and the poor, and when they see little chance of bridging that gap through legal means, they often turn to illegal activities.

According to **TÜİK** data, youth unemployment has reached alarming levels in recent years, making it easier for young people to engage in activities outside the bounds of society (TÜİK, 2023). In this context, illegal betting and prostitution have become more prevalent among Turkish youth.

### 2. **Migration and Demographic Shifts**

Additionally, there is the ever-growing population of **illegal migrants**—those who have entered Turkey through illegal means and remain unregistered—and the negative attitudes Turkish society has developed towards them. Studies indicate that perceptions of economic and social threats posed by these migrants are particularly high. A significant portion of Istanbul residents view migrants as a threat, further weakening social bonds. In certain sections of society, **violence against Syrian migrants** and other undocumented individuals has increased. This trend is a result of the failure to rebuild norms, leading to increasing alienation between groups and a rise in the potential for societal violence (İstanPol, 2020).

### 3. **Political Polarization**

The **Turkey Trends Survey** of 2022 paints a picture of how deeply divided Turkish society has become politically. The increasing polarization between different political groups shows that society is drifting away from shared norms. As we observed during the election campaigns, political debates in both traditional and social media were often conducted in a language of hostility, exacerbating divisions. This has weakened trust between different segments of society and reinforced a "us versus them" mentality. What one group sees as right becomes unacceptable to another.

The reality is that polarization creates an environment where society can no longer unite around common values, which is one of the clearest signs of normative disintegration (Global Academy, 2022).

### 4. **Perception of Justice and Social Insecurity**

Can a society survive without trust in its justice system? When individuals with criminal records walk free without serving their sentences, when members of criminal organizations roam the streets without fear, or when countless other cases (that we cannot fully enumerate here) come to mind, it becomes clear that trust in rules and justice has diminished across society. A weakened perception of justice leads to societal breakdown, alienating individuals from norms and institutions. The **World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index** from 2022 supports this view, showing that Turkey ranks low in terms of public trust in the justice system (World Justice Project, 2022).

### Conclusion

After reviewing what we’ve discussed so far, it becomes clear that societal norms are starting to break down, and individuals find themselves unable to adapt to this new social order. They feel increasingly insecure, unjust, and disconnected from the norms that once bound them. This is leading individuals to withdraw from society and engage in behaviors that harm both themselves and others. Durkheim's concept of **anomie** seems to provide a useful lens for understanding the social events that have unfolded in Turkey in recent years. In summary, the economic crisis, the migration issue, political polarization, and the lack of trust in the justice system have pushed Turkish society into a state of normative disintegration, eroding trust and shared values across the board.
